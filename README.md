# CSS-File-Generator
Generates a CSS file that generates a random Font, Background Color, and Text Color to common HTML tags

## Usage

main.py contains 4 Constant Variables near the top of the file
`MIN-WIDTH`, 
`MAX-WIDTH`, 
`MIN-HEIGHT`, 
`MAX-HEIGHT`.

These represent the minimum and maximum view-port widths and heights the program will account for.

The program will write `style.css` in the same directory that the program will run in.

## Version Changelog:

### V2.1
  - Optimized File Writing, the write buffer will no longer contain the full file at a time.

### V2.0 - The Height Update
 - Media Queries Now Include Height As Well As Width
   
### V1.1 Changes
 - Added More Fonts
